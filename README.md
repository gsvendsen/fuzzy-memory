### Introduction
Fuzzy Memory is an assignment where I had to make a memory game only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The requirements were that the game randomized a minimum of 8 pairs of cards and had a restart button.

#### Features
- Visual timer with a line growing around the memory board
- Different themes to choose from through a theme querySelector
- Ability to choose difficulty (timer speed)
- Shuffle/restart button

#### Testers
